# ![](icon.png) Emblems

Emblems for Star Shard Studio generated with [Emblematic](https://github.com/steffo99/emblematic).

## Why PNG?

SVG support in applications seems to be very poor, so a raster alternative had to be used.

## Why no Git LFS?

Some applications do not support Git LFS properly, and that may impede the use of these emblems.
